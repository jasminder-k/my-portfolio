Portfolio

In order to implement my portfolio project, I have used Bootstrap theme by integrating it to React app.
- Index.js component renders App Component.
- App component renders NavBar component and uses react-router-dom for Home, About, Projects and Resume Components also a footer component called Footer.
- Home component renders Header (it contains the profile image and a hero section) and About me section.
- About component contains a generic information about myself and the different ways to reach me out and check out my github handle.
-Projects Component contains an overview of projects on which I've worked during my professional experience.
- Resume Component contains information about my overall skills and education.

-Note : Contact Component is WORK IN PROGRESS.
